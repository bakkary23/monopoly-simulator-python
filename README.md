# monopoly-simulator-python
Portfolio Project - Intro to Computer Science Course

This program simulates a simplified version of the game monopoly. It creates a game
object whose methods can be called to play the game. Players roll one die and loop around a game board
of 25 spaces. Spaces can be purchased and then if landed on by a non-owner player will charge rent.
A player loses if their account balance reaches zero. The last player with a nonzero bank account is
the winner.
